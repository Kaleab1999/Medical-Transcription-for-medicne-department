Classification of Medical Transcriptions
Overview
This project focuses on the classification of medical transcriptions into their respective specialties. The goal is to automatically categorize transcribed medical documents, which is crucial for efficient record-keeping, data analysis, and workflow automation in healthcare settings.

Problem Statement
Medical transcriptions are a vital part of clinical documentation, but manual sorting and categorization can be time-consuming and prone to human error. This project addresses this challenge by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to accurately classify transcriptions based on their content, saving valuable time and improving organizational efficiency.

Models Used
Our approach utilizes state-of-the-art transformer-based models, which have shown exceptional performance in various NLP tasks, particularly in the biomedical domain.

BioBERT: A BERT-based model pre-trained on large-scale biomedical corpora. BioBERT is specifically suited for tasks involving medical and clinical text, making it a powerful tool for this project.

RoBERTa: A robustly optimized BERT pre-training approach that can be used for general-purpose NLP tasks and adapted for the medical domain through fine-tuning.
